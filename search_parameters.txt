Explanations:

cache: If you include other words in the query, Google will highlight those words within
        the cached document. For instance, [cache:www.google.com web] will show the cached
        content with the word web highlighted. This functionality is also accessible by
        clicking on the Cached link on Googles main results page. The query [cache:] will
        show the version of the web page that Google has in its cache. For instance,
        [cache:www.google.com] will show Googles cache of the Google homepage. Note there
        can be no space between the cache: and the web page url.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
link: The query [link:] will list webpages that have links to the specified webpage.
        For instance, [link:www.google.com] will list webpages that have links pointing to the
        Google homepage. Note there can be no space between the link: and the web page url.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
related: The query [related:] will list web pages that are similar to a specified web
        page. For instance, [related:www.google.com] will list web pages that are similar to
        the Google homepage. Note there can be no space between the related: and the web
        page url.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
info: The query [info:] will present some information that Google has about that web
        page. For instance, [info:www.google.com] will show information about the Google
        homepage. Note there can be no space between the info: and the web page url.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
define: The query [define:] will provide a definition of the words you enter after it,
        gathered from various online sources. The definition will be for the entire phrase
        entered (i.e., it will include all the words in the exact order you typed them).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
stocks: If you begin a query with the [stocks:] operator, Google will treat the rest
        of the query terms as stock ticker symbols, and will link to a page showing stock
        information for those symbols. For instance, [stocks: intc yhoo] will show information
        about Intel and Yahoo. (Note you must type the ticker symbols, not the company name.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
site: If you include [site:] in your query, Google will restrict the results to those
        websites in the given domain. For instance, [help site:www.google.com] will find pages
        about help within www.google.com. [help site:com] will find pages about help within
        .com urls. Note there can be no space between the site: and the domain.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
allintitle: If you start a query with [allintitle:], Google will restrict the results
        to those with all of the query words in the title. For instance,
        [allintitle: google search] will return only documents that have both google
        and search in the title.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
intitle: If you include [intitle:] in your query, Google will restrict the results
        to documents containing that word in the title. For instance, [intitle:google search]
        will return documents that mention the word google in their title, and mention the
        word search anywhere in the document (title or no). Note there can be no space
        between the intitle: and the following word. Putting [intitle:] in front of every
        word in your query is equivalent to putting [allintitle:] at the front of your
        query: [intitle:google intitle:search] is the same as [allintitle: google search].
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
allinurl: If you start a query with [allinurl:], Google will restrict the results to
        those with all of the query words in the url. For instance, [allinurl: google search]
        will return only documents that have both google and search in the url. Note
        that [allinurl:] works on words, not url components. In particular, it ignores
        punctuation. Thus, [allinurl: foo/bar] will restrict the results to page with the
        words foo and bar in the url, but wont require that they be separated by a
        slash within that url, that they be adjacent, or that they be in that particular
        word order. There is currently no way to enforce these constraints.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inurl: If you include [inurl:] in your query, Google will restrict the results to
        documents containing that word in the url. For instance, [inurl:google search] will
        return documents that mention the word google in their url, and mention the word
        search anywhere in the document (url or no). Note there can be no space between
        the inurl: and the following word. Putting inurl: in front of every word in your
        query is equivalent to putting allinurl: at the front of your query:
        [inurl:google inurl:search] is the same as [allinurl: google search].
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ext: If you include [ext:] into your search, it will ONLY include results ending
     with that file extension. Examples would be ext:pdf, ext:csv, ext:docx, etc

Also, if you want to search things via Boolean, you can use "|".

Example:

site:google.com (ext: pdf | docx | ps | bak).

This will search google.com for pdf AND docx AND ps AND bak files.

To exclude a parameter, use the '-' character.

Example:

site:google.com intext:"I love food" -ext:pdf

This will EXCLUDE results that are in PDF format
