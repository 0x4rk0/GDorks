# What is this?

Big ol' list of Google and Github dorks. Most of these links were pulled from the Google Hacking Database (see how-to.txt on how I did it)

## Installation

There is none! Just git clone this repo and you are set.

## What is the purpose?

Find files, specific text, URL patterns, caches, etc with Google. Use it to find Excel spreadsheets on Yomomma.com.

## Isn't this illegal?

Depends on who you ask. I am not a lawyer. Use at your own discretion.
